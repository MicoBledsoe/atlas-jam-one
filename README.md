# First Pass: The Silent Game Jam

Welcome to the First Pass Game Jam, a unique challenge designed to push the boundaries of collaborative game development under a set of intriguing constraints. This game jam invites participants to contribute to a collective game project in shifts, with a twist on the traditional collaborative process.

## Overview

In this game jam, developers work in 1-2 hour shifts to add their contributions to a tiny scope game. The catch? There's absolutely no communication allowed between participants. Each developer must intuitively build upon the previous contributions without any form of direct discussion, notes, or explicit guidance.

### Additional Twist

Each iteration of the game jam introduces a new 'twist' or rule that significantly alters the game's direction or design. This rule is revealed at the start of the jam to ensure all participants can incorporate this element into their development process.

## Base Rules

- **No Direct Communication**: Participants must not leave messages, comments, or instructions for other developers. The development process should be entirely based on interpretation and intuition.

- **Build Iteratively**: Aim to add to the project constructively, focusing on enhancement without negating or removing previous contributions.

- **Keep It Appropriate**: All content introduced into the game must be suitable for a general audience, adhering to community guidelines and ensuring inclusivity.

## How to Participate

1. **Sign Up**: Register for a shift through the designated sign-up system. Remember, your shift is a commitment to contribute to the game's development for 1-2 hours.

2. **Review**: Before your shift starts, familiarize yourself with the current state of the game. This will be your only insight into the project's direction.

3. **Develop**: Add your unique contribution to the game. Whether it's coding, design, art, or sound, ensure it aligns with the project's current trajectory and the additional twist.

4. **Submit**: Once your shift is over, submit your contributions according to the provided instructions. Ensure your code is clean, commented, and integrates smoothly with the existing project.

## Schedule

The game jam starts on [Start Date] and ends on [End Date]. The revealing of the 'twist' will occur one day before the jam starts.

## Tools and Resources

[List any recommended tools, engines, or resources participants might find helpful. This could include links to Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, or asset libraries that fit the game jam's theme and rules.]

## Final Showcase

At the conclusion of the game jam, the final game will be showcased to all participants and the wider community. This will be a time to celebrate the collective creativity and effort put into the project, showcasing the diverse interpretations and additions each developer has made.
